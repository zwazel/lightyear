//! This example showcases how to use Lightyear with Bevy, to easily get replication along with prediction/interpolation working.
//!
//! There is a lot of setup code, but it's mostly to have the examples work in all possible configurations of transport.
//! (all transports are supported, as well as running the example in listen-server or host-server mode)
//!
//!
//! Run with
//! - `cargo run -- server`
//! - `cargo run -- client -c 1`
